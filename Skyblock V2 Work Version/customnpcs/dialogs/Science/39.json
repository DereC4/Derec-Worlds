They're so stupid, that they sell things for EMERALDS! I know right? Anyways, we monitor them and let them roam around freely. Then, we send in some synthetic ones, \"Synths\" I like to call them. Identical in every way. I've seen NPCS like these however, that are much smarter. Check out Aquarius if you haven't already. Tons of them there. So I guess they're separated in 3 classes. Advanced, like me, Normal, like the ones that have somewhat developed minds, and Vegetables, like these. Fun to play around with huh?",
